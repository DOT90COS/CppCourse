/**************************************************
Write an application that will:

* Take exactly one command line parameter with the filename of
  the file to be processed

* Read the numbers in from that file. The file should be in the 
  format of "98, 43, 34". i.e. it will start with and number and 
  end with a number. All numbers will be seperated by a comma. 

* Determine the min number, the max number, the median number and
  the mean number and print them to the screen. 

* Determine the number that appears the most in the file.

* Write all the numbers back out to a file named the same as the input
  filename BUT with .sorted.txt appended to the filename. 

  YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE AN ARRAY TO STORE DATA ONLY STL CONTAINERS!!!: 

Things to think about:
* Which containers would be good for sorting the data?
* Which containers would be good for indexing the numbers?
* What container would make it easy to get the median number out of?
