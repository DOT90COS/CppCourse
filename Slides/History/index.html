&#x2015; Bjarne Stroustrup</p><div class="notes"><p>When we take about C++ we have to really specify what iteration of C++ we are talking about.
C++ has changed dramatically over the years and even through recent times. It is important to
understand the evolution of C++ and the state of the standards, libraries, and compilers that
you will depend on to do your jobs. You will find many projects that are built on top of old runtimes
for various reasons. The standard process has be revolutionized and moves quickly now. In this decade
there have been two standards release that dramatically changed the language and there will be one more
with C++17. This is why we have a section on the history of C++.</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="1" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="1600" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="current-state-of-c">Current State of C++</h1><img src="images/wg21-timeline.png" alt="C++ standards timeline." width="900px"></img></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="2" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="3200" data-y="0" data-z="0"><img src="images/dennis_richie.gif"></img><p><strong>In 1970 Dennis Ritchie Introduces C</strong></p><dl><dt>Prior to this:</dt><dd><ul><li>Systems programmers were expected to master machine language</li><li>Systems programmers wrote in assembly</li><li>Fortran and Cobol existed for domain specialist not "systems" programming</li></ul></dd><dt>C gave systems programmers:</dt><dd><ul><li>A high level language that was portable.</li><li>Enough control to do most systems programming</li></ul></dd></dl><div class="notes"><p>What were Cobol and Fortran domain languages for?</p><p>COmmon Business Oriented Language - as the expanded acronym indicates, COBOL is designed for

language for distributed systems simulations in his research. He was disappointed with its poor
performance, however, and in 1979 when his new employer, AT&amp;T Bell Labs, said "Do something interesting",
he decided to infuse the C language with some Simula features he had grown accustomed to -- most notably classes --
and thus "C with Classes" was born. It caught on within AT&amp;T, was dubbed C++, and then proceeded to become a support
burden for its inventor.  -- taken from <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/cuj_interview.html">http://www.stroustrup.com/cuj_interview.html</a></p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="4" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="6400" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="factoids">Factoids</h1><blockquote><ul><li>First C with classes compiler was called "Cfront" which was derived from a C compiler called CPre</li><li>Cfront was written mostly in C with Classes, making it a compiler that could compile itself.</li><li>The name C with classes was changed in 1983 to C++ and new features were added<ul><li>virtual functions</li><li>function overloading</li><li>references</li><li>const</li><li>single-line comments</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="5" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="8000" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="road-to-standardization">Road to Standardization</h1><ul><li>1985 "The C++ Programming Language" first edition is released</li><li>Popularity soars into the 90s largely credited to OOP and GUI programming</li><li>A decision to standardize the language is made and group has first meeting in 1989<ul><li>The language will be controlled by a group of people instead of one member.</li><li>Stroustrup remains an influential member to the ISO C++ committee to this day.</li><li>First goals were to standardize iostreams, add templates, and exceptions.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="notes"><ul><li>The 1985 was a very important reference as the language wasn't standardized yet.</li></ul></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="6" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="9600" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="lack-of-standard-library">Lack of standard library</h1><ul><li>1993 Standard was almost complete.</li><li>Committee felt there wasn't a good enough standard library.</li><li>Alex Stepanov gave a presentation on generic programming which put templates to good use.</li><li>By the next meeting Stepanov had refined the "Standard Template Library".</li><li>The committee liked it even if it delayed the completion of the standard.</li><li>It wasn't until 1998 that the C++ standard was finalized.</li></ul><div class="notes"><p>This were winding down in 1993 but uneasiness about a lack of robustness in the standard library cause .</p></div></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="7" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="11200" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="boost">Boost</h1><ul><li>Also in 1998 Beman Dawes with Library Working Group chair, set up the Boost Libraries.</li><li>Libraries that might be candidates for standardization could be vetted and popularize.</li><li>Boost is separate from the standards process.</li><li>Library writers don't have to submit their libraries to boost but is usually happens that way.</li></ul><img src="images/boost.jpg"></img></div><div class="step step-level-1" step="8" data-rotate-x="0" data-rotate-y="0" data-rotate-z="0" data-scale="1" data-x="12800" data-y="0" data-z="0"><h1 id="c-as-a-superset-of-c">C++ as a superset of C</h1><ul><li><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Instant access to all libs written in C</li><li>Introduce safer ways to deal with resources RAII</li><li>Higher-level concepts (Generic but most of this class will be teaching this.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Inherits all of C's baggage</li><li>Making more powerful user-defined types of C++ integrate
